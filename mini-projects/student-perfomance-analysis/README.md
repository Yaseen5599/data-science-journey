## PROBLEM STATEMENT:The project was to analyze the student perfomance data.
### PROCESS:

- My aim is to analyse the average perfomance,is attendace related to marks also to find out the low perfomers.
- i had used histogram,boxplot and scatter plot to analyse data using graphs and fill the unknown values by finding the average value of each attribute.
### INSIGHTS:
- From the given data i have analysed that attendance is related with students perfomance .
- Also i detected the low perfomers from the list to provide more focus to them.
- i had used histogram,boxplot and scatter plot to analyse data using graphs and fill the unknown values by finding the average value of each attribute.
### DECISIONS:
- minimum 80% Attendace should be made mandatory.
- mentoring and focus should be given on low perfomers. Assumptions:
- if attendance of a student is increased he should have performed better.
- if we pickup and focus on low perfomers they should also performed better.

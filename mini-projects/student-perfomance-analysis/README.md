## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify
factors affecting academic outcomes.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to understand performance variation and recommend
actions to improve results.

## Dataset
- Student age
- Attendance percentage
- Exam marks
- Missing and inconsistent values were present

## Approach
- Data cleaning with justified decisions
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical reasoning
- Decision-focused insights

## Key Findings
- Attendance shows a positive relationship with marks
- Performance varies significantly among students
- Some missing data limits conclusions

## Recommendation
- Focus on attendance improvement programs
- Provide support for low-performing students

## Limitations
- Small dataset
- Correlation does not imply causation

## Real-World Considerations

### Data Limitations
This analysis is based on a limited dataset and does not include several real-world factors that may influence student performance, such as:
- Student involvement in extracurricular activities that reduce class attendance
- Number of revision classes attended by each student
- College events where attendance is recorded but no classes are conducted
- Teacher effectiveness or student ratings per subject
- Students’ academic performance in previous years

### Assumptions
Due to missing contextual information, the analysis treats attendance as an indicator of engagement rather than a direct cause of performance. It assumes that comparing current performance with past performance may help identify external factors affecting student outcomes.

### Additional Data Needed
Including behavioral, instructional, and historical performance data would improve confidence in the insights and help validate whether the observed patterns generalize beyond the current dataset.

##  Day 1

What i did:
- Created Github repository
- Installed Anaconda
- created my first data frame

what confused me:
-running the python code in a notebook was little confusing first but was very easier when i realised how it is done.

Thing i learned:
-data is just structured rows and columns.
-how to write and run a basic code in jupyter notebook.

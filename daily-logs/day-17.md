- One insight that only appeared after segmentation : The medium and high attendace group have students who almost performed the same .I found out that analysing a student's perfomance with medium and high attendace level may  be less reliable from now.
- One average that was misleading: The formation of a perfomance trend when we analyse the data in whole was misleading rather than grouping into segments.We formed new insights when we segment the students into three groups based on their attendace.
- One decision that became clearer: The low attendance student perform the worst among all of them.They should be focused from now on and regular monitoring should be done if they show improvement in their perfomance.

*What was hard:
  -This is the first project where i used my brain to solve the problem without any external help.
  -filling the unknown values in the table was little harder at beginning but now i understand how it works.
*What i were unsure about:
  -I am unsure about the type of plots i need to use to undertand the relation of variables with the perfomance of a student.
  -Also how to get a conclusion from all these plots.
*What you’re proud of:
  -I completed my fist data science project.
  -Eventhough it is a mini project it is a great achievement for me who learn from scratch.
  -I learned to fill essential unknown data also how to filter how to plot it and how to get insight from it.
  -I also learned a basic to make a decision from the insights of data.

- Where I felt uncertain: I felt uncertain about how to fill the unkown in attendance and median .I first filled with median and mean and then looked into the scatter plot. For Every  students the mark increases when attendance increases expect the value i filled.So i tried median instead of mean.Still the same.I found it difficult to do what next.But when i reasearched more i understand that it is normal and we are now in the realistic situation and i think like a data scientist and think of the external factors and find out attednace is only an indicator and not an attribute which is sufficient alone to make a decision.
- One decision you’re proud of : I made attendance as a primary indicator to enter into the second phase where i will include external factor like behavioural,institutional and physiological factors which may contribute to the pefomance. In second phase the data which is taken into consideration is Previous year's attendace and marks. Include internal marks to deeply analyse the students perfomance across the year.Also we need to include  a column for each student showing their ratings of their teacher made by them.A possible column we need to add is the distance of home from the institution because the time of travel reduce the learning hours.A survey from students regards of factors whcih reduce their learning hours will definitely help to gather and analyse more data to produce a more accurate and relaible data.
- One thing you’d ask if this were real : Does attendace alone make a student perform better .Also a student which has good external factors having low attendace perform better or worse.Considering these factors can we consider attendance as a primary indicator .
